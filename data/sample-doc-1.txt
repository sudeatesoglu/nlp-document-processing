Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a sub-field of artificial intelligence that
focuses on the interaction between computers and humans through natural language.
The ultimate goal of NLP is to enable computers to understand, interpret,
and generate human language in a way that is valuable. Applications of NLP are numerous and include machine translation,
sentiment analysis, text summarization, and more.
